## Setting Up Dev Environment

### Step One - Software:

- Install latest version of Node.js, https://nodejs.org/en/
- 'npm' is installed through Node.js, followed in further steps.

### Step Two - Directory Change:

- Boot up TWO instances of Node.js Command Prompt (NOT Node.js!!)
- Create a Folder in any desired path, we will use this as a -master folder to hold and organize. My directory looks like such:

C:\Users\willy\Desktop\Wireframes-master 

- In the command prompt we have to change the directory in order to properly install npm to the correct folder. To do so, make another folder in the -master folder that will hold all of our assests, modules, .html, .scss, and so on. My directory looks like such: 

C:\Users\willy\Desktop\Wireframes-master\Front

- In your terminal, type 'cd', this will be our command for changing paths. To properly do so, type 'cd <YOUR PATH DIRECTORY>' into the terminal. Hit Enter. When completed it should look like this: 
  
'''  

C:\Users\willy\Desktop\Wireframes-master\Front>

'''

### Step Three - Setting up npm:

- In our new directory, we must install npm, but before so we must create a package.json file, that will hold our scripts and dependencies further down the line.
